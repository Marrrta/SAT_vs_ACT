### Project 1: SAT/ACT Investigation

### Problem Statement

This project attempts to validate the need for two separate standardized aptitude tests used for college admissions in the USA. 
By examining the popularity and results of both SAT and ACT across all states, as well as the acceptance requirements of top academic institutions in the country that involve these tests, the analysis:

1. Evaluates the reasons for both tests to be maintained;

2. Sizes the opportunity to switch to either only SAT or ACT, either US-wide or for select states;

3. Assesses the differences in distribution of results to determine whether the (inconsistent) claims that one of the tests is "easier" than the other are justified;

4. Provides inputs for high school students as they choose between SAT and ACT in order to get accepted to their prefered college.
